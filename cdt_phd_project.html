    <h1>Project description</h1>
    <p>Digital pathology slides have very high resolutions, increasing neural network layer sizes and training times, with patch learning reducing image context.</p>
    <p>My research aims to focus on digital pathology slide dimensional reduction using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and their different varieties.</p>
    <p>With other focusses on image patch context learning, network parallelisation using cloud services, pathology slide data creation using VAE latent space, transfer learning within latent space and focussing neural networks.</p>
    <p>Another possible area of research is segmentation, classification and anomaly detection using VAE latent space, by using outlier detection and manipulation techniques.</p>
    <p>The research will also aim to create documentation on the current state of the research area, including taxonomies of VAEs and other novel techniques.</p>
